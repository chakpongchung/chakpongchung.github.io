  <h3><i>About Me</i></h3>
  I am a second year graduate student in Computational and Applied Mathematics. My working experience is mainly in the intersection of mathematics and computer science, like Numerical Analysis, Scientific Computing and Algorithm Design. 
  <br><br>
  Large part of my day is waiting for students to my TA session or running experiments on clusters, from there I develop the interest in computer systems. 
  OSdev and xv6 have my attention recently to build layers between booting and loading OS kernel, as I am thinking whether we can better utilize those idle machines surrounding us. 
  
  Some readings I am working on to achieve this goal:
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_Rvgpne5ZoUgaaLxh53Gqs8cRdQbu7S7MfbIVNQFxbc/edit?usp=sharing" title="">list</a>
  
  To have more exposure in related area and better prepare me to solve the problem, I start to work on the OMSCS master degree from <a href="http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/" title="">Georgia Tech</a> <!-- I also have a great interest in machine learning, operating system, system programming and socket programming. --> 
  <br><br>
  I received my BSc in Mathematics from <a href="http://www.math.ust.hk/people/faculty.php" title="">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology</a>.  In my spare time, I like to stay active. I enjoy going to the gym and hiking</a>.

  <h3><i>Work Experience</i></h3>


  <b class="title"> <a href="http://www.genomics.cn/en/index">Beijing Genomics Institute</a></b> <br>
  <i><font size="2"> June 2014  August 2014 , Hong Kong</font></i> <br><br>


Next-generation sequencing technology provides the opportunity to study cancer genomics at a single-nucleotide resolution. This technology provides researchers with massive amounts of data, but how can we mine it for useful information?

The task: Given sequencing data from a normal tissue sample and sequencing data from a tumor sample, identify the somatic mutations present in the tumor genome.

  <ul>
    <li>C++ Implementation of Parallel Neural Network with openMP in learning DNA sequencing data
    <li>Evaluated several classification and clustering techniques (KNN, PCA, Naive Bayes, SVM, etc.) in machine learning to separate somatic mutations from non-somatic ones
    <li>The final report for the project can be found  
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B07OecC53Z0deVRaTHpGNlpjMlU/view?usp=sharing" title="">here</a>.

  <b class="title"> Web</b> <br>

    <ul>
    <li> Database (with MongoDB,MySQL);
    developer of <a href="http://samedaygrocerydelivery.net" title="">samedaygrocerydelivery.net</a> combining PHP,JavaScript,JQuery and Bootstrap.
<!--	Here is a preliminary functional <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B07OecC53Z0dOFMxMGZnQTNoTTg/view?usp=sharing" title="">prototype</a>.-->
    </ul>

  <b class="title"> CMOS VLSI DESIGN</b>
  <br>
<ul> 
  <li>In the summer course CMOS VLSI DESIGN, we designed an 8-bit Algorithmic Logical Unit, which can process 8-bit addition/subtraction, an operator to perform not A and B, and a comparator</a>
  <li>This helps us to familiarize the IC design process with Candence. After this we have a better view how layout is built up to manufacture an IC. Delay and the size of the layout
      is optimized to meet the project requirement</a> 
  <li>Here is the project <a href="https://goo.gl/yPuqJT" title="">report</a>
</ul>

  <b class="title"> Fluid flow past arbitrary obstacles</b> <br>
  <br>
  Implement a 2D solver for fluid flow past arbitrary obstacles(e.g. Cylinder), cavity flow and channel flow in Fortran and C++ with Lattice Boltzmann method and openMP. 
  For those interested in what do they look like, you can see the following video.
