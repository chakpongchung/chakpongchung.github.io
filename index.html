      <h3><i>About Me</i></h3>
      I spent two years as a Ph.D. student in Computational and Applied Mathematics. My working experience is mainly in the intersection of mathematics and computer science, like Numerical Methods, Scientific Computing and Algorithm Design. 
      <br><br>
      Large part of my day is waiting for students to my TA session or running experiments on clusters, from there I develop the interest in computer systems. 
      <!--OSdev and xv6 have my attention recently to build layers between booting and loading OS kernel, as I am thinking whether we can better utilize those idle machines surrounding us. -->
      <!--Some readings I am working on to achieve this goal:-->

      To have more exposure in related areas, I start to work on the OMSCS master degree from <a href="http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/" title="">Georgia Tech.</a> <!-- I also have a great interest in machine learning, operating system, system programming and socket programming. --> 
      My B.S. is in Mathematics from <a href="http://www.math.ust.hk/people/faculty.php" title="">Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong</a>.  
      <br><br>
      In my spare time, I enjoy learning and like to stay active. Hiking is my favorite in Hong Kong. Now I go to gym more often</a>.

      <b class="title"> Fluid flow past arbitrary obstacles</b> <br>
      <br>
      Implement a 2D solver for fluid flow past arbitrary obstacles(e.g. Cylinder), cavity flow and channel flow in Fortran and C++ with Lattice Boltzmann method and openMP. 
      For those interested in what do they look like, you can see the following video.

      <b class="title"> CMOS VLSI DESIGN</b>
      <br>
      <ul>
         <li>In the summer course CMOS VLSI DESIGN, we designed an 8-bit Algorithmic Logical Unit, which can process 8-bit addition/subtraction, an operator to perform not A and B, and a comparator</a>
         <li>This helps us to familiarize the IC design process with Candence. After this we have a better view how layout is built up to manufacture an IC. Delay and the size of the layout
            is optimized to meet the project requirement</a>
